# Elite Dangerous Binding Switcher

A simple utility written in JavaScript that facilitates the process of switching between different custom binds files in Elite Dangerous.

## Usage

1. Get a `.binds` file from https://edrefcard.info/

2. Rename the file to `anything you want_but-it-MUST-end-with.edbs`

   - Note the file extension `.edbs`- this is important!

3. Place the `.edbs` file(s) next to the EDBS executable

4. Run the executable and select your bindings

5. Launch Elite Dangerous and Fly Safe!

## Troubleshooting

#### My selection list says [N/A]

- No `.edbs` files were found.
  - Ensure that the files exist in the same folder as the executable
  - Confirm that the file extensions are `.edbs`

## P.S. to Linux Users

I don't know if this works, but I tried. Good luck!
